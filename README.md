# Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning

## Description

This repository contains code for fine-tuning pre-trained deep learning models using transfer learning on a specific dataset.

### Problem Statement

The problem statement involves classifying X-ray images of lungs into various categories based on the presence or absence of lung cancer. The dataset consists of thousands of X-ray images captured from patients with different conditions, including lung cancer and non-cancerous abnormalities. The task is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify these X-ray images into their respective categories, aiding in the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this task is the Lung X-ray Dataset, which consists of X-ray images of lungs collected from various medical institutions and annotated with their corresponding labels. The dataset contains images of lungs with different conditions, such as normal lungs, lungs with lung cancer, and lungs with other abnormalities. It is divided into training, validation, and test sets, with a total of 10,000 images.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the fine-tuned models, the following evaluation metrics are chosen:

- Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified images out of the total.
- Loss: Measure of the model's performance during training, indicating how well it is minimizing errors.
- Precision: Measure of the model's ability to correctly classify positive cases.
- Recall: Measure of the model's ability to identify all relevant instances.
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

## Findings and Discussion

The experiments conducted on fine-tuning pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 revealed some interesting findings. Overall, transfer learning proved to be effective in improving the classification performance on the fruit recognition task. By leveraging features learned from large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, the fine-tuned models were able to achieve higher accuracy and better generalization compared to training from scratch.

However, there were some limitations observed during the experiments. Fine-tuning deep neural networks requires careful selection of hyperparameters and tuning of the learning rate to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the choice of pre-trained model architecture and the size of the dataset can significantly impact the performance of the fine-tuned models.
